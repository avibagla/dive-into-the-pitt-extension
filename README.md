# Dive into *The Pitt* Chrome Extension

Experience "*The Pitt*" TV show in real-time! This extension synchronizes your viewing with the show's 15-hour emergency room shift timeline.

## Features

- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Automatically navigates to the correct episode and timestamp based on the current time

- **9:00 AM** = Episode 3: "9:00 A.M."
- ... and so on until ...
- **9:00 PM** = Episode 15: "9:00 P.M."
- **10:00 PM** = End of shift

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Time Mapping**: Real-world time (7 AM - 10 PM) maps to episodes 1-15
2. **Episode Detection**: Identifies "*The Pitt*" episodes via URL patterns and page content
3. **Smart Seeking**: Calculates correct timestamp within each episode
4. **Gap Handling**: Shows countdowns during the time between episode end and next hour
5. **URL Navigation**: Automatically switches episodes when needed

### Episode Timing Logic

Since episodes are typically 40-50 minutes (except the last which is 60 minutes), there are natural gaps. The extension:
- Plays the episode content during the "active" portion of each hour
- Shows countdown timers during gaps
- Ensures episodes end at the top of each hour (credits time)

### Episode IDs

Currently, we have the episode ID for Episode 2. As more episodes are released, we'll need to update the `episodes` array in both `content.js` and `popup.js` with the correct episode IDs from Max URLs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Extension manifest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js             # Main extension logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css             # UI styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html             # Extension popup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js               # Popup functionality
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
```

### Adding New Episodes

When new episodes are released, update the `episodeId` field in the `episodes` array:

```javascript
{ episode: 3, title: "9:00 A.M.", episodeId: "NEW_EPISODE_ID_HERE", duration: 2640 }
```

You can find episode IDs from the Max URL when watching an episode:
`https://play.max.com/video/watch/{show-id}/{episode-id}`

### Customization

- **Shift Start Time**: Modify `shiftStartTime` logic in `startRealTime()`
- **Check Interval**: Adjust `checkInterval` timing (currently 5 seconds)
- **Episode Durations**: Update duration estimates for better seeking accuracy

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Episode duration detection** from video metadata
- [ ] **Timezone support** for different viewing times
- [ ] **Weekend/holiday scheduling** options  
- [ ] **Rewind capability** to replay parts of the shift
- [ ] **Statistics tracking** (total shifts worked, favorite episodes)
- [ ] **Social features** (share your shift progress)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Requires Max subscription**: This extension only works with legitimate Max access
- **Episode availability**: Some episodes may not be available yet (check episode IDs)
- **Browser support**: Currently Chrome only (Firefox version possible)
